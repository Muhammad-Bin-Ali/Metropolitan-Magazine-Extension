# Metropolitan SimpliRead 0.1.0

Metropolitan SimpliRead is a chrome extension that allows users to summarize articles. It connects to a python RESTFUL Flask backend which uses popular natural language processing libraries to provide grammatically cohesive summaries. The stack also contains a MongoDB Atlas Cluster which provides users with the option to save summaries for later use. 

- Built using Vanilla Javascript

The project is yet to be deployed, but the source files can be downloaded and be tested through Chrome's developer mode.
